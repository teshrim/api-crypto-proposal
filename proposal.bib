  abstract="Public-key encryption schemes rely for their IND-CPA security on
    per-message fresh randomness. In practice, randomness may be of poor quality
    for a variety of reasons, leading to failure of the schemes. Expecting the
      systems to improve is unrealistic. What we show in this paper is that we
        can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the lack of possible
        randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes that achieve
        IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high quality, but,
        when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking completely, they
          achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security that we call
          IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the best possible
          security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We provide simple
          RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge secure with
          minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model schemes relying
          on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from deterministic
          encryption. They achieve adaptive security by establishing and
          exploiting the anonymity of LTDFs which we believe is of independent
          interest.",

  fully-secure schemes for some related and challenging forms of public-key
    encryption (PKE), namely deterministic and hedged PKE. These forms of PKE
    defend against subversion of random number generators, an end given new
    urgency by recent revelations on the nature and extent of such subversion.We
    resolve the (recognized) technical challenges in reaching these goals via a
    new paradigm that combines UCEs (universal computational extractors) with
    LTDFs (lossy trapdoor functions). Crucially, we rely only on a weak form of
    UCE, namely security for statistically (rather than computationally)
    unpredictable sources. We then define and achieve unique-ciphertext PKE as a
    way to defend against implementation subversion via algorithm-substitution
    attacks.",

    OCB-AES or CTR-AES (on Haswell, AEZ has a peak speed of about 0.7 cpb). To

  a pseudorandom injection (PRI), which we prove to be equivalent. We provide a
    DAE construction, SIV, analyze its concrete security, develop a
    blockcipher-based instantiation of it, and suggest that the method makes a
    desirable alternative to the schemes of the X9.102 draft standard. The
    construction incorporates a method to turn a PRF that operates on a string
    into an equally efficient PRF that operates on a vector of strings, a
    problem of independent interest. Finally, we consider IV-based
    authenticated-encryption (AE) schemes that are maximally forgiving of
    repeated IVs, a goal we formalize as misuse-resistant AE. We show that a DAE
    scheme with a vector-valued header, such as SIV, directly realizes this
