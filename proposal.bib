  abstract="Public-key encryption schemes rely for their IND-CPA security on
    per-message fresh randomness. In practice, randomness may be of poor quality
    for a variety of reasons, leading to failure of the schemes. Expecting the
      systems to improve is unrealistic. What we show in this paper is that we
        can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the lack of possible
        randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes that achieve
        IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high quality, but,
        when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking completely, they
          achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security that we call
          IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the best possible
          security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We provide simple
          RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge secure with
          minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model schemes relying
          on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from deterministic
          encryption. They achieve adaptive security by establishing and
          exploiting the anonymity of LTDFs which we believe is of independent
          interest.",

  fully-secure schemes for some related and challenging forms of public-key
    encryption (PKE), namely deterministic and hedged PKE. These forms of PKE
    defend against subversion of random number generators, an end given new
    urgency by recent revelations on the nature and extent of such subversion.We
    resolve the (recognized) technical challenges in reaching these goals via a
    new paradigm that combines UCEs (universal computational extractors) with
    LTDFs (lossy trapdoor functions). Crucially, we rely only on a weak form of
    UCE, namely security for statistically (rather than computationally)
    unpredictable sources. We then define and achieve unique-ciphertext PKE as a
    way to defend against implementation subversion via algorithm-substitution
    attacks.",

  abstract="We provide the first provable-security analysis of the Intel Secure
    Key hardware RNG (ISK-RNG), versions of which have appeared in Intel
    processors since late 2011. To model the ISK-RNG, we generalize the
    PRNG-with-inputs primitive, introduced by Dodis et al. at CCS'13 for their
    /dev/[u]random analysis. The concrete security bounds we uncover tell a
    mixed story. We find that ISK-RNG lacks backward-security altogether, and
    that the forward-security bound for the ``truly random'' bits fetched by the
    {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt {\{}RDSEED{\}}{\$}{\$}
  instruction is potentially worrisome. On the other hand, we are able to prove
    stronger forward-security bounds for the pseudorandom bits fetched by the
    {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt {\{}RDRAND{\}}{\$}{\$}
  instruction. En route to these results, our main technical efforts focus on
    the way in which ISK-RNG employs CBCMAC as an entropy extractor.",
