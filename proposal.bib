  abstract="Public-key encryption schemes rely for their IND-CPA security on
    per-message fresh randomness. In practice, randomness may be of poor quality
    for a variety of reasons, leading to failure of the schemes. Expecting the
      systems to improve is unrealistic. What we show in this paper is that we
        can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the lack of possible
        randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes that achieve
        IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high quality, but,
        when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking completely, they
          achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security that we call
          IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the best possible
          security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We provide simple
          RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge secure with
          minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model schemes relying
          on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from deterministic
          encryption. They achieve adaptive security by establishing and
          exploiting the anonymity of LTDFs which we believe is of independent
          interest.",

  abstract="Hedged PKE schemes are designed to provide useful security when the
    per-message randomness fails to be uniform, say, due to faulty
    implementations or adversarial actions. A simple and elegant theoretical
    approach to building such schemes works like this: Synthesize fresh random
    bits by hashing all of the encryption inputs, and use the resulting hash
    output as randomness for an underlying PKE scheme.",
