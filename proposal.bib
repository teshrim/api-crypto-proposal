  abstract="Public-key encryption schemes rely for their IND-CPA security on
    per-message fresh randomness. In practice, randomness may be of poor quality
    for a variety of reasons, leading to failure of the schemes. Expecting the
      systems to improve is unrealistic. What we show in this paper is that we
        can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the lack of possible
        randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes that achieve
        IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high quality, but,
        when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking completely, they
          achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security that we call
          IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the best possible
          security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We provide simple
          RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge secure with
          minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model schemes relying
          on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from deterministic
          encryption. They achieve adaptive security by establishing and
          exploiting the anonymity of LTDFs which we believe is of independent
          interest.",

      the given MAC is unforgeable under chosen-message attack. We provide

  abstract="In the context of authenticated encryption (AE), generic composition
    has referred to the construction of an AE scheme by gluing together a
    conventional (privacy-only) encryption scheme and a MAC. Since the work of
    Bellare and Namprempre (2000) and then Krawczyk (2001), the conventional
    wisdom has become that there are three forms of generic composition, with
    Encrypt-then-MAC the only one that generically works. However, many caveats
    to this understanding have surfaced over the years. Here we explore this
    issue further, showing how this understanding oversimplifies the situation
    because it ignores the results' sensitivity to definitional choices. When
    encryption is formalized differently, making it either IV-based or
    nonce-based, rather than probabilistic, and when the AE goal is likewise
    changed to take in a nonce, qualitatively different results emerge. We
    explore these alternatives versions of the generic-composition story. We
    also evidence the overreaching understanding of prior generic-composition
    results by pointing out that the Encrypt-then-MAC mechanism of ISO 19772 is
    completely wrong.",

    abstract="Symmetric encryption schemes are usually formalized so as to make
      the encryption operation a probabilistic or state-dependent
      function $\epsilon$ of the message M and the key K: the user supplies M
      and K and the encryption process does the rest, flipping coins or
      modifying internal state in order to produce a ciphertext C. Here we
      investigate an alternative syntax for an encryption scheme, where the
      encryption process $\epsilon$ is a deterministic function that surfaces an
      initialization vector (IV). The user supplies a message M, key K, and
      initialization vector N, getting back the (one and only) associated
      ciphertext
      {\$}C={\backslash}cal E{\_}K^N(M){\$}              . We concentrate on the
    case where the IV is guaranteed to be a nonce---something that takes on
      a new value with every message one encrypts. We explore definitions,
      constructions, and properties for nonce-based encryption. Symmetric
        encryption with a surfaced IV more directly captures real-word
        constructions like CBC mode, and encryption schemes constructed to be
        secure under nonce-based security notions may be less prone to misuse.",

  providing definitions, constructions, and proofs. We suggest that key-wrap's
    goal is security in the sense of deterministic authenticated-encryption
    (DAE), a notion that we put forward. We also provide an alternative notion,
  a pseudorandom injection (PRI), which we prove to be equivalent. We provide a
    DAE construction, SIV, analyze its concrete security, develop a
    blockcipher-based instantiation of it, and suggest that the method makes a
    desirable alternative to the schemes of the X9.102 draft standard. The
    construction incorporates a method to turn a PRF that operates on a string
    into an equally efficient PRF that operates on a vector of strings, a
    problem of independent interest. Finally, we consider IV-based
    authenticated-encryption (AE) schemes that are maximally forgiving of
    repeated IVs, a goal we formalize as misuse-resistant AE. We show that a DAE
    scheme with a vector-valued header, such as SIV, directly realizes this
    goal.",
